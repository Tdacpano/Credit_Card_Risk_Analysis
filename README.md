# Cryptocurrencies- Overview

  In this analysis we used a credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, and applied unsupervised learning by oversampling the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. We then use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Followed by comparing two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. 


# Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

# Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
